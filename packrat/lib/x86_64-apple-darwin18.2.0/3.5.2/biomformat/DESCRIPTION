Description: This is an R package for interfacing with the BIOM format.
    This package includes basic tools for reading biom-format files,
    accessing and subsetting data tables from a biom object (which is
    more complex than a single table), as well as limited support for
    writing a biom-object back to a biom-format file. The design of
    this API is intended to match the python API and other tools
    included with the biom-format project, but with a decidedly "R
    flavor" that should be familiar to R users. This includes S4
    classes and methods, as well as extensions of common core
    functions/methods.
