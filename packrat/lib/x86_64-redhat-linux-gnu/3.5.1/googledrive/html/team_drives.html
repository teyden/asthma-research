<h2>Access Team Drives</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>How to capture a Team Drive or files/folders that live on a
Team Drive for downstream use:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code><a href="drive_find.html">drive_find()</a></code> and <code><a href="drive_get.html">drive_get()</a></code> return a <code><a href="dribble.html">dribble</a></code> with metadata on
files, including folders. Both can be directed to search on Team Drives,
using the optional arguments <code>team_drive</code> or <code>corpus</code> (documented below).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code><a href="team_drive_find.html">team_drive_find()</a></code> and <code><a href="team_drive_get.html">team_drive_get()</a></code> return a <code><a href="dribble.html">dribble</a></code> with
metadata on Team Drives themselves. You will need this in order to use a Team
Drive in certain file operations. For example, you can specify a Team Drive
as the parent folder via the <code>path</code> argument for upload, move, copy, etc.
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Regard the functions above as the official &quot;port of entry&quot; for
Team Drives and Team Drive files and folders. Use them to capture your
target(s) in a <code><a href="dribble.html">dribble</a></code> to pass along to other googledrive functions.
The general flexibility to refer to files by name, path, or id does not
apply to Team Drive files. While it's always a good idea to get things into
a <code><a href="dribble.html">dribble</a></code> early, for Team Drives it's absolutely required.
</p>
<p>Note: <a href="https://gsuite.google.com/learning-center/products/drive/get-started-team-drive/">Team Drives</a>
are only available to users of certain enhanced Google services, such as G
Suite Enterprise, G Suite Business, or G Suite for Education.
</p>


<h3>Specific Team Drive</h3>

<p>To search one specific Team Drive, pass its name, marked id, or
<code><a href="dribble.html">dribble</a></code> to <code>team_drive</code> somewhere in the call, like so:</p>
<pre>drive_find(..., team_drive = "i_am_a_team_drive_name")
drive_find(..., team_drive = as_id("i_am_a_team_drive_id"))
drive_find(..., team_drive = i_am_a_team_drive_dribble)
</pre>
<p>The value of <code>team_drive</code> is pre-processed with <code><a href="as_team_drive.html">as_team_drive()</a></code>.
</p>


<h3>Other collections</h3>

<p>To search other collections, pass the <code>corpus</code> parameter somewhere in the
call, like so:</p>
<pre>drive_find(..., corpus = "user")
drive_find(..., corpus = "all")
drive_find(..., corpus = "domain")
</pre>
<p>Possible values of <code>corpus</code> and what they mean:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>"user"</code>: Queries files that the user has accessed, including both Team and
non-Team Drive files.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"all"</code>: Queries files that the user has accessed and all Team Drives in
which they are a member. If you're reading the Drive API docs, this is a
googledrive convenience short cut for <code>"user,allTeamDrives"</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>"domain"</code>: Queries files that are shared to the domain, including both
Team Drive and non-Team Drive files.
</p>
</li></ul>



<h3>API docs</h3>

<p>googledrive implements Team Drive support as outlined here:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><a href="https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/enable-teamdrives#including_team_drive_content_fileslist">https://developers.google.com/drive/v3/web/enable-teamdrives#including_team_drive_content_fileslist</a>
</p>
</li></ul>

<p>Users shouldn't need to know any of this, but here are details for the
curious. The extra information needed to search Team Drives consists of the
following query parameters:
</p>

<ul>
<li> <p><code>corpora</code>: Where to search? Formed from googledrive's <code>corpus</code> argument.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>teamDriveId</code>: The id of a specific Team Drive. Only allowed &ndash; and also
absolutely required &ndash; when <code>corpora = "teamDrive"</code>. When user specifies a
Team Drive, googledrive sends its id and also infers that <code>corpora</code> should
be set to <code>"teamDrive"</code> and sent.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>includeTeamDriveItems</code>: Do you want to see Team Drive items? Obviously,
this should be <code>TRUE</code> and googledrive sends this whenever Team Drive
parameters are detected
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>supportsTeamDrives</code>: Does the sending application (googledrive, in this
case) know about Team Drives? Obviously, this should be <code>TRUE</code> and
googledrive sends it for all applicable endpoints, all the time.
</p>
</li></ul>
