Title: Resampling-based multiple hypothesis testing
Version: 2.38.0
Author: Katherine S. Pollard, Houston N. Gilbert, Yongchao Ge, Sandra

Description: Non-parametric bootstrap and permutation resampling-based
    multiple testing procedures (including empirical Bayes methods) for
    controlling the family-wise error rate (FWER), generalized
    family-wise error rate (gFWER), tail probability of the proportion
    of false positives (TPPFP), and false discovery rate (FDR).
    Several choices of bootstrap-based null distribution are
    implemented (centered, centered and scaled, quantile-transformed).
    Single-step and step-wise methods are available. Tests based on a
    variety of t- and F-statistics (including t-statistics based on
    regression parameters from linear and survival models as well as
    those based on correlation parameters) are included.  When probing
    hypotheses with t-statistics, users may also select a potentially
    faster null distribution which is multivariate normal with mean
    zero and variance covariance matrix derived from the vector
    influence function.  Results are reported in terms of adjusted
    p-values, confidence regions and test statistic cutoffs. The
    procedures are directly applicable to identifying differentially
    expressed genes in DNA microarray experiments.
